  his smart kitchen projector can be mounted underneath the kitchen wall cabinet or
  directly onto the wall, projecting a fully-fledged GUI on the kitchen worktop.
  A bright and high-contrast projection in combination with an integrated 3D sensor
  then “transforms” the kitchen worktop into a smart display. The real benefit during
  cooking and baking is that the interface can also be tapped or swiped with wet or sticky fingers.

  This product is RedDot winner in 2020.</h5>
